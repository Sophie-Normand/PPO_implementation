## CLERGUE Eva, NORMAND Sophie
### M2 Data Science, Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the results on different experiments using Proximal Policy optimization algorithm. The code of this implementation is originally proposed on this repository : https://github.com/nikhilbarhate99/PPO-PyTorch.

Gym environments considered : CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2, BipedalWalker-v2
Experiment 1 : learning rates of Actor and Critic neural networks
Experiment 2 : clipping parameter value for PPO
